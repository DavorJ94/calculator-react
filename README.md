# Calculator created using React

A project I made a while ago. Refactoring completed during May 2021. Initial version of the code can be seen on github, as well as current version. Compared to the initial code, current (refactored) version of the code is much shorter and has less bugs (if any, to the best of my knowledge).

Precision of the calulator is up to 4 decimal places.

App can be previewed at https://davorj94.github.io/calculator-react. Let me know if you think that there is something that should be improved in the code.
